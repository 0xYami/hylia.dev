## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software development. They provide a template for solving issues in a way that is both proven and effective. In JavaScript, leveraging design patterns helps create more organized, readable, and maintainable code.

### The Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

```javascript
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = this;
    }

    return Singleton.instance;
  }
}

const instance1 = new Singleton();
const instance2 = new Singleton();

console.log(instance1 === instance2); // true
```

### The Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

```javascript

class Subject {
  constructor() {
    this.observers = [];
  }

  addObserver(observer) {
    this.observers.push(observer);
  }

  notifyObservers() {
    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update());
  }
}

class Observer {
  update() {
    // Update logic here
  }
}

const subject = new Subject();
const observer1 = new Observer();
const observer2 = new Observer();

subject.addObserver(observer1);
subject.addObserver(observer2);

subject.notifyObservers();
```

### The Module Pattern

The Module pattern allows you to create private and public encapsulation, reducing global scope pollution. It's a powerful way to organize your code and promote reusability.

```javascript

const Module = (function() {
  // private variables and functions
  let privateVar = 'I am private';

  // public API
  return {
    publicVar: 'I am public',
    getPrivateVar: function() {
      return privateVar;
    }
  };
})();

console.log(Module.publicVar);
console.log(Module.getPrivateVar());
```
