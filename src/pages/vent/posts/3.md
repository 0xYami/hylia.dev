It looks like I'm returning to the world of VTubing, but this time, it's a whole new beginning. New accounts, a fresh name, exciting content, and brand-new ideas.

Over the past few months, life has thrown its fair share of curveballs my way, and it's high time for a fresh start, embracing new challenges with open arms.

If you're as passionate about VTubing as I am, be sure to check out the [Vtuber Wiki](https://wiki.hylia.dev). It's a goldmine of information on VTubing and the vibrant community of VTubers.

On this new journey, I'm making a commitment to myself. Prioritizing mental health, seeking professional help, and taking steps toward a brighter, happier future.

I can't express enough gratitude to the incredible people who have been by my side throughout this journey. Shoutout to [@whooith](https://twitter.com/whooith), [@SplattBacky](https://twitter.com/SplattBacky), [@ShardVT](https://twitter.com/ShardVT), [@EdgyVT](https://twitter.com/EdgyVT), and all of you who've been the best of friends. Your support and friendship mean the world, and I'm counting on your continued encouragement as I embark on this crucial journey of healing and recovery.

Let's do this, and let's do it together!
