I'm really struggling, and it feels like a never-ending cycle of failure. 

I keep diving into new projects, hoping to make something work, but it always ends up in disappointment. 

- I started a Linktree-like application. It failed.
- I created an AI. It failed.
- I made an anime/Vtuber card game Discord bot. It failed.
- I even attempted to establish a Vtuber agency. It failed too.

It's incredibly frustrating, and I wish I could find a way to break free from this cycle.

But it's not just about my projects failing; it's also about self-doubt. I don't think I'll ever be a good creator or Vtuber. I'm lost and have no idea what to post or say.

It's like, "What the fuck am I doing with my life?"

I'm stuffing and I don't know what to say.

I'm wondering if this is all worth it. It may not be worth it, but I don't know.
