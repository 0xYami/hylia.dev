# Depression and Suicidal Thoughts

Over the past months, I've been battling depression, a silent but incredibly challenging foe. This battle has been a long and exhausting one, and it's taken a significant toll on my emotional and mental well-being. Unfortunately, it's also led to suicidal thoughts, which have been both frightening and overwhelming.

It's crucial to understand that mental health is a serious issue, and seeking help and support is crucial. I've made the choice to prioritize my mental health and take the necessary steps to recover and heal. If you or someone you know is struggling with similar feelings, please reach out to a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.

# Growth as a VTuber and Creator

Beyond my mental health struggles, I've also come to realize that VTubing might not be the path where I can truly grow as a content creator. The VTubing community is vibrant and full of talented individuals, but it's also highly competitive and challenging. Creating engaging and entertaining content can be incredibly demanding, and it often requires a level of consistency and energy that I'm unable to maintain due to my mental health issues.

I've learned a lot during my time as a VTuber, and I'm grateful for the support and encouragement I've received from my viewers and the community. However, I believe that stepping away from VTubing is the best decision for my overall well-being and future.

# Moving Forward

I don't want this announcement to be seen as the end, but rather as a new beginning. I'm going to focus on my mental health, seeking professional help, and working towards a healthier and happier future. It's a challenging journey, but I'm determined to come out of it stronger and more resilient.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has supported me on this VTubing journey. Your encouragement, comments, and interactions have meant the world to me. I hope to remain connected with you in some capacity in the future, and who knows, maybe one day I'll be in a better place to return to content creation.

Remember, it's essential to prioritize your mental health and well-being, and there's no shame in seeking help when needed. Thank you for understanding, and I hope you'll continue to support and care for me as I take this important step towards healing and recovery.

Take care, and stay well. ðŸŒŸ
